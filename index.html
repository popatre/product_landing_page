                 and the greater Sacramento Area. A studio is used for teaching in Folsom but teachers can travel to your home for an extra fee especially if it's in Folsom or El Dorado Hills. </p>

                <h3> How it works </h3>
                <p>Bring in any music, either notated on sheet music, or on an iPod or CD, and we'll learn how to play like your favorite musicians, or how to make the songs your own! </p>

                <h3> What will I learn?</h3>
                <p>We will help you build and polish a strong foundation of Technique, Theory, Improvisation & Repertoire. We will explore sight reading, groove, harmony and melody, and examine how different rhythms and scales function in real musical situations. </p>
